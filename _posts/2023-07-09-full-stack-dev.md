title: I am a full-stack developer now
---
For the last 5 years, I am purely working in **backend development**. I got some frontend development tasks which were very boring and in vanilla HTML, and CSS. I tried to avoid them and had the mindset that the front end is dull and monotonous.

A few days back I got a call from an interviewer, I cleared **n** rounds and had **n** discussions (everything was moving in a positive direction) but in the end, their **CTO** denied to give me the expected compensation because I did not have much experience in the **front end**. 

*Considering the fact they want someone to work on everything whenever required. I tried to understand why they are sceptical about my skills. Finally, I convinced them to give me a task on the front end.

The task was to develop Hacker New's new clone in **React JS**. Considering React concepts like composability, state management, server-side and client-side rendering etc. So I spent my whole weekend and came up with a Hacker News clone in **Next JS**.
Although I ruined my sleep cycle and missed work deadlines, I am happy that I learned new things and was able to deliver the project on time.

After completing the task when I retrospect I can say that frontend technologies are also very interesting and a lot of innovative things are happening over there. Probably I will make a few more projects in front-end frameworks to get more familiar with them.
